### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Results of the linear regression suggest the vehicle length and ground clearance, as well as the intercept are statistically unlikely to provide non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero?
No, the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. The equation for multiple linear regression is y = m<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub> + m<sub>n</sub>x<sub>n</sub> + b. The slope of each variable is dispalyed in the first column (i.e. Estimate) of the above output.
### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively?
Yes, both the Multiple R-Squared value (0.7149) and Adjusted R-Squared value (0.6825) suggest a strong correlation, 0.8261 and 0.8455 respectively. The p-value is also statistically significant.

### The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually?
