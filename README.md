### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Results of the linear regression suggest the vehicle length and ground clearance, as well as the intercept are statistically unlikely to provide non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero?
No, the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. The equation for multiple linear regression is y = m<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub> + m<sub>n</sub>x<sub>n</sub> + b
### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively?
